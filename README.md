# IVFCR_ExtendedStudy_LENAValidation
This directory contains code that analyses day-long recordings of infant and adult caregiver vocalisations to validate findings from our previous study (Ritwika et al. 2020) and to test the validity of the LENA automatic labelling using an extended collection of human-labelled data

LENADataProcessing contains code to extract LENA labels as well as acoustics from .wav and .its files, while files in HumanLabelDataProcessing extracts human listeneer labels as well as acoustics for 5 minute segments labelled by human listsenrs. Please run all code in the LENADataProcessing folder before proceeding to the HumanLabelDataProcessing folder
