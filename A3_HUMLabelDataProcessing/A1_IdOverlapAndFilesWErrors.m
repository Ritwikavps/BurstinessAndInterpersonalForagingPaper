%Ritwika VPS, UCLA; July 2022

%Updated June 2023, post the clean-up effort by Ritwika and Jeffrey in May 2023
% Prior to this clean-up effort, there were files which contained errors (see relevnt directory; A2_HUMLabelDataCleanUp), so it was necessary to exclude those files, 
% and so, this script contained some code to do that. Post- the May 2023 clean-up effort, this is no longer necessary, and I have removed those portions of code, and 
% am leaving this note here to sort of point to the fact that extensive data cleanup has been performed, and also, in case the need to add similar portions of code 
% ever arises.
% 
% This script also returns summary numbers for the overlap processing process and saves the relevant table in metadatafiles. 

% As of now, this script checks if there are overlapping vocalisations, splits overlapping vocs into non-overlapping sub-vocs where possible, and
% otherwise tags those vocs as overlapping so they are not used in acoustic analysis

%set BasePath and working directory; CHNAGE PATH AS NECESSARY
BasePath = '/Users/ritwikavps/Desktop/GoogleDriveFiles/research/IVFCRAndOtherWorkWithAnne/Pre_registration_followu/Data/HUMLabelData/A2_HUMLabelData_PostCleanUp/';

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%The basic idea is to pick out all CHN and AN vocs, sort them by start time into a single table, index each voc with a sequential index (1, 2, 3....), identify
% and flag overlapping vocs (see below; utilises user-defined function), and chop up all overlapping vocs into overlapping and non-overlapping sub-vocs while
% also storing the info about the voc index of the original un-chopped up vocalisation. So, if Voc 3 is chopped up into 3 sub-vocs, they will all have the voc
% index 3. Note that this chopping up of overlapping vocs is done recursively (see below; utilises user-defined function). We will later use this voc index info 
% to stitch back vocs together after acoustic processing.

%initialise various overlap counters. Eg. FullOlpCtr (vector with one entry each for CHNSP, CHNNSP, and AN, in that order) counts number of instances when an utterance is 
% overlapped fully (straddled fully) by another utterance type such that the focal utterance is fully processed out after olp processing. For the first element in FullOlpCtr,
% this number corresponds to the number of CHNSP utterances that are fully overlapped by an adult utterance (CHNSP cannot be fully overlapped by a CHNSP type 
% because they are two distinct utterance types from the same vocaliser). The second and third elements index full overlaps for CHNNSP and AN vocs, similarly. 
% PartialOlpCtr counts the number of times there is a partial overlap such that some portion of the utterance in question remains after overlap processing. The PartialOlpCtr
% vector is also in the order of number of partial overlaps for CHNSP, CHNNSP, and AN.
% DurSums_PreOlp and NumSums_PreOlp tracks the total duration and number of the vocalisation type in question prior to overlap processing, in the order of CHNSP, CHNNSP, and AN.
% Finally, DurSums_PostOlp and NumSums_PostOlp tracks the total duration and number of the vocalisation type in question after to overlap processing, in the order of CHNSP, 
% CHNNSP, and AN.
