This directory contains code written to perform data analysis presented in the Burstiness paper.

The directory names are indexed as A1, A2, etc. to indicate the order to follow during execution. See relevant `README` files in each directory for details about the contents of each directory. See below for a broad overview of the contents of each directory.

`A1_ResponseAnalyses_IEIs` contains code used to merge vocalisations of the same label type separated by 0 s IEIs (see Section S6.2 in the Burstiness paper for details), perform the two-step response analyses controlling for correlations between consecutive IEIs, and generate data and results for all associated plotting. These analyses actions are performed for all datasets presented in the Burstiness paper. 
    
`A2_DataSummaryAnalyses` contains code that gets various summary measures describing the data analysed. The bulk of supplementary figures for the Burstiness paper are generated using data summary files resulting from code in this directory.

`A3_ReliabilityAnalyses` performs reliability analyses whose results are presented in the relevant supplementary section of the Burstiness paper.
