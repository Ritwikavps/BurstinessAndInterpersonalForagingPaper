`A1_ReliabilityMaster.m` is the only executable script in this folder with all other scripts being required user-defined functions. This script generates comprehensive reliability metrics (Cohen's kappa, percent agreement, false alarm rate, miss rate, confusion rate, identification error rate, precision, recall) at the validation data file level as well as 5-minute section level for LENA 5 minute data tested against human listener labelled 5-minute sections with all adult vocalisations included and with only infant-directed adult vocalisations included. Reliability metrics are computed after 5-minute sections are chopped up into 1 ms frames (`Get1msVocChunks.m` with error checks in this process done using `CheckErrorsIn1msVocChunkFile.m` for randomly chosen validation files). The functions `GetPrecisionAndRecallMats.m` and `GetReliabilityErrorNum.m` are used to estimate reliability metrics. The computed reliability numbers (estimated using MATLAB's `confusionmat` function) are tested against reliability numbers estimated by explicitly writing code using `CheckReliabilityNumFrames_MatlabVsUser.m`. Finally, common sense checks are carried out using `MasterChecksForReliability_HumVsLENA.m`.
