%Reliability code: this script estimates reliability measures between human-listener labelled 5 minute sections and corresponding LENA sections, by computing the following metrics:
% false alarm rate, miss rate, confusion rate, identification error rate, precision, and recall, per Cristia et al, 2021. Note that we use 1 ms frames as opposed to Cristia et al's 
% 10 ms frames, because the human listener labels are determined to 0.001 seconds.

%"These are calculated with the following formulas at the level of each clip, where:
    %- FA (false alarm) is the number of frames during which there is no talk according to the human annotator but during which LENA速 found some talk; 
    %- M (miss) is the number of frames during which there is talk according to the human annotator but during which LENA速 found no talk; 
    %- C (confusion) is the number of frames correctly classified by LENA速 as containing talk, but whose voice type has not been correctly identified (when the LENA速 model 
        % recognizes female adult speech where there is male adult speech for instance)
    %- T is the total number of frames that contain talk according to the human annotation
%Then, False alarm rate = FA/T; miss rate = M/T; confusion rate = C/T; Id error rate = (FA + M + C)/T

%This script ALSO computes the Precision and recall confusion matrices to quantify human-LENA inter-rater reliability, as described in Cristia et al, 2021. Note that we use 1 ms 
% frames as opposed to Cristia et al's 10 ms frames, because the human listener labels are determined to 0.001 seconds.

%Precision is a measure of LENA's precision, i.e, for each category, it is the number of frames LENA and human annotator agree on, divided by the total number of frames LENA labelled as that
    % category. That is, it is ratio of how often LENA was correct for a category (eg. CHNSP) and how often LENA overall labelled that category. Put more simply, it is a measure of how often
    % was LENA correct.
    %In the confusion matrix for precision, the (i,j)th element--where human labels are indexed by  i (the row index; true values) and the LENA labels are indexed by j (the col index; test 
        % values)-- is given by the number of frames labelled as category j by LENA that are labelled as category i by the human listener, divided by the total number of frames that 
        % are labelled j by LENA. That is, the (i,j)th element is the proportion of frames that are labelled j by LENA that correspond to category i as labelled by the human listener.
        % Note that every column sums to 1. 
%Recall is a measure of how much of the 'correct' tag (as labelled by the human annotator) did LENA accurately identitfy (or recalled/recovered). So, this is the number of frames LENA and 
    % human annotator agree on for a category divided by the number of frames the human annotator id'd as that category.
    %In the confusion matrix for recall, the (i,j)th element--where human labels are indexed by  i (the row index; true values) and the LENA labels are indexed by j (the col index; test 
        % values)-- is given by the number of frames labelled as category j by LENA that are labelled as category i by the human listener, divided by the total number of frames that 
        % are labelled i by the human listener. That is, the (i,j)th element is the proportion of frames that are labelled j by LENA that correspond to category i as labelled by the human 
        % listener. Note that every row sums to 1. 
    % Also note that for precision and recall, the numerator remains the same, and it is the denominator that changes.

    %make output tables
    %1. make table for precision and recall numbers (note that these are the number of frames taht go into calculating prcison and recall). Note that NumFrameMatch_Label_i is a 
    % 1-by-numel(VocLabels) cell array, where the ith element of the cell array is an N-by-1 array, where N = toal number of sections/files. Cell2mat-ing this gives an N-by-numel(VocLabels) 
    % array where the i-th column gives the number of frames id'd by both LENA and human annotator as the i-th voc label category for that section/file. NumDenom_PrecisionRowVec is an N-by-1
    % cell array where each element is a row vector of size 1-by-numel(VocLabels). Cell2mat-ing this similarly gives an N-by-numel(VocLabels) array where the i-th column gives the number of 
    % frames id'd by LENA as the i-th voc label category for that section/file. Finally,NumDenom_RecallColVec is an N-by-1 cell array where each element is a column vector of size 
    % 1-by-numel(VocLabels). Cell2mat-ing a*and* transposing (in that order) gives an N-by-numel(VocLabels) array where the i-th column gives the number of frames id'd by human annotator 
    % as the i-th voc label category for that section/file
