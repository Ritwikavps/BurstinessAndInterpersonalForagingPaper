%This script identifies cases (for the human listener labelled data ONLY) where the annotations for vocs that were merged due to an intervening 0 IVI do not matcg. For eg, if two Adult 
% vocs are merged into one but the annotations for the unmerged ones are T and U (instead of being T and T, or U and U). Another example would be two Infant vocs merged but the 
% annotations for the unmerged vocs are X and C (instead of being X and X, or C and C). This doesn't pose an issue for adult vocs, because in the case where we do not consider 
% directedness, and use all adult vocs in our analyses, this would just merged adult vocs wiuth different annotations but sepoarated by 0 IVI into one voc. When we only consider 
% child-directed adult vocs in our analyses, we first select all adult vocs annotated T, and then only merge these.
% However, for infant vocs, there is an argument for keeping vocs with different annotations separate, since these, even when separated by a 0 IVI, are technically distinct vocs. Note,
% however, that we separate CHNSP (annotations X and C) and CHNNSP (annotations R and L) vocs, so two vocs won't be merged if one is CHNSP and the other is CHNNSP. This script is 
% intended to provide a sense of how many such merges exist, for both adult and infant vocs, so we can get a sense of the proportion of vocs affected by this concern and whether we need
% to build in any checks and balances for this.
% As it turns out, there are only 2 such infant merges, where X and C types are merged together, and as such, there doesn't seem to be a need to account for this, especially since none
% of our analyses (currently) rely on the sub-categories (at the annotation level) of CHNSP and CHNNSP, or of Adult vocs. In addition, the rationale for merging vocs with 0 IVIs apply
% here, since the goal was to remove the 0 Ivi cases, to fix the 'skew'/discontinuity in the data due to the presence of 0 Ivis otherwise. Also note that this is only a concern for the 
% human-listener labelled data, since this fine-grained-level of annotations is only availble for the human-listener labelled data.
